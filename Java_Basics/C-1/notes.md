### Understanding JDK JRE JVM

- JDK (Java Development Kit) is the set of tools and libraries that allow you to write Java programs.
- It includes:
  - Compiler (javac) → converts your code into bytecode.
  - Java libraries → pre-written code you can use (like System.out.println).
  - JVM → so you can run your program.
  - Other tools → debugger, doc generator, etc.

- JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the environment that runs your Java program.
- It includes:
  - JVM → so you can run your program.
  - Other tools → debugger, doc generator, etc.

- JVM (Java Virtual Machine) you can think of JVM as a virtual computer inside your real computer..
- It reads bytecode and executes it.

### JDK vs JRE

- JDK is the set of tools and libraries that allow you to write Java programs.
- JRE is the environment that runs your Java program.


### Lifecycle of a Java Program

1. Write your code.
2. Compilation → converts your code into bytecode. (Example: javac Main.java)
3. Execution → runs your program. (Example: java Main)
